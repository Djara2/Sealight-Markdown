line 21: The beginning of a **new** idea
line 22: regular text
line 23: _ deflist
line 24: a deflist is a way of doing definitions for terms
line 25: In Sealight Markdown, a deflist is delimited by "\_ "
line 26: _
line 27: The third **ever** commit to this project allows for *italic*, **bold**, and ***italic bold text***. Isn't that pretty cool? *I think so.* In fact, I would say that **many people think it is coool.**
line 28: With the new im**pro**vement of the scheme for parsing through lower-order tokens, you can make ANY character italic, bold, or italic bold, not just whole tokens.
line 29: # September 5th, 2023 Improvements
line 30: You can also have ++underlined text++ now. Individu++a++l characters should work as well.
line 31: You can also apply ==highlighting== to text! Highlighting uses the == delimiter 
line 32: Common programming notation will not accidentally collide with the syntax for bold, underline, and highlight
line 33: ```
line 34: if(COMPILER == "sealight")
line 35: {
line 36: 	productivity++;
line 37: }
line 38: ```
line 39: Originally, if you wrote \\\_ you would have seen it just like that, but now it will correct the escape characters to just \_ . It is the same deal for writing \\\* as well, which will now appear as just \*.
line 40: You can also now use underscores to initiate italic, bold, and bold italic text. For example, writing \_italic\_ will give you _italic_, writing \_\_bold\_\_ will give you __bold__, and writing \_\_\_italic bold\_\_\_ will give you ___italic bold___.
line 41: # September 6th, 2023 Improvements
line 42: If you write [toc] as the first line of the file, then a table of contents will be automatically generated. As the document is built, all of the headers will be kept track of, and sent to stdout before the real HTML conversion.
line 43: The listings in the table of contents will also be clickable links that will take you to those sections of the page. Ironically though, the parser cannot pick up on other Markdown links (yet). 
line 44: Subheaders will be indented in the table of contents accordingly.
line 45: Special characters in headers will be detected and converted to their respective HTML codes when their IDs are being constructed for the table of contents. Doing this makes it so that headers like "September 6th, 2023 Improvements" do not create broken links.
line 46: h1 headers will be followed by a horizontal rule
line 47: Expanded the amount of special characters supported in headers (as it pertains to clickable links in the Table of Contents)
line 48: Horizontal rules are supported. For this, write three hyphens (---), followed immediately by a newline and nothing else. For example, the line after this will be a horizontal rule.
line 49: ---
line 50: The document now has a small margin on the left and right. This improves readability.
