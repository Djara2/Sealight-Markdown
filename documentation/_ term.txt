1. break the line apart into tokens delimited by spaces
2. check each token if it is bold
3. if bold, change the token to include equivalent HTML tags
4. join all the tokens
5. set string_tokens[i] to the joined tokens

Consider cases in this order:
1. is italic bold initiated and terminated
2. is italic bold initiated 
3. is italic bold terminated
4. is bold initiated and terminated
5. is bold initiated
6. is bold terminated
7. is italic initiated and terminated
8. is italic initiated
9. it italic terminated

-------------------------------
1. new function that checks if the string
contains "**" at any points and returns the
INDEX of where the pattern begins. Call this 
value X.

2. check if the rest of the string (starting 
from the index returned by the function in 
step 1, plus 2 -- to skip over the remaining
indices containing '*') also has "**". Call this
value Y. If this is the case (Y != -1) then the substring 
starting from the index X + 2 until Y (exclusive) is bold.

3. The bold substring from step 2 may be the whole string or 
part of the string. You have continue this process until it is not
possible for the rest of the string to contain "**". You can check
this by seeing if strlen(test_string) - Y >= 3

"d**av**id"       strlen -> 9
 012345678        x -> 1 ... x + 2 = 3
                  y -> 5 ... y + 2 = 7
                  it is not possible that there 
                  are any more bold openings/closings
                  in the string, because there are only
                  2 characters left in the string adjacent
                  to Y + 1. This can be seen from the fact
		  that strlen("d**av**id") - (Y+2) = 2

if we had "d**av**ide" as the string, it would be possible
that there is another bold opener, since there are 3 more characters

"d**av**ide"       strlen -> 10

                   --------------------
                   it is possible that there are 
                   more bold openings/closings
                   in the string, because there are
                   3 characters left in the string adjacent
                   to Y + 1 (6). This can be seen from the fact
		   that strlen("d**av**ide") - (Y+2) = 3
