# Introduction

This is my introduction. I hope it is good.

## Sub header

Let's see if it can work on subheaders well.

```
int i = 0;
if(i < 2)
{
	printf("Cool!\n");
}
```

!!! example Admonition time 
if you give a mouse a cookie

then that is pretty cool

I support that fully.

!!! tip Admonition after another admonition
This is a fun project.

# New Header

The beginning of a **new** idea

regular text

_ deflist
a deflist is a way of doing definitions for terms
In Sealight Markdown, a deflist is delimited by "\_ "
_

The third **ever** commit to this project allows for *italic*, **bold**, and ***italic bold text***. Isn't that pretty cool? *I think so.* In fact, I would say that **many people think it is coool.**

With the new im**pro**vement of the scheme for parsing through lower-order tokens, you can make ANY character italic, bold, or italic bold, not just whole tokens.

# September 5th, 2023 Improvements

You can also have ++underlined text++ now. Individu++a++l characters should work as well.

You can also apply ==highlighting== to text! Highlighting uses the == delimiter 

Common programming notation will not accidentally collide with the syntax for bold, underline, and highlight
```
if(COMPILER == "sealight")
{
	productivity++;
}
```

Originally, if you wrote \\\_ you would have seen it just like that, but now it will correct the escape characters to just \_ . It is the same deal for writing \\\* as well, which will now appear as just \*.

You can also now use underscores to initiate italic, bold, and bold italic text. For example, writing \_italic\_ will give you _italic_, writing \_\_bold\_\_ will give you __bold__, and writing \_\_\_italic bold\_\_\_ will give you ___italic bold___.
